ENGETO SQL PROJECT
---------------------
Introduction:
I would like to share with you my SQL project that was assigned in Data Academy. It uses all the knowledge that I learned during the SQL academy, especially: 
Some basics SELECT, INSERT INTO, WHERE, AND, OR, ORDER BY, CASE Expression, LIKE and IN operators, nested SELECT, VIEWS
Backup & Restore, SUM() + MAX() and other aggregation functions, GROUP BY, SELECT operations
Database schema, joining tables using different variants of JOIN, set operations (e.g. UNION, EXCEPT, ...), Common Table Expressions

Project Structure
- documentation
- files with answers answer1.sql
- files with tabler primary.sql

# Answers to questions

1. Over the years have wages been rising in all sectors or falling in some of them?
   
2. How many litres of milk and kilograms of bread can be bought in the first and last comparable period in the available price and wage data?

3. Which food category is becoming more expensive at the slowest rate (lowest percentage increase year-on-year)?

4. Is there any year in which the annual increase in food prices was significantly higher than wage growth (greater than 10%)?

5 . Does the level of GDP affect changes in wages and food prices? Alternatively, if GDP rises more significantly in one year, will this be reflected in more significant increases in food prices or wages in the same or subsequent year?
